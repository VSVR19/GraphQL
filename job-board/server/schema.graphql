# This is a very simple GraphQL schema definition file.
# It defines a single query called "greeting" that returns a String.
type Query {
  # greeting: String
  # Job! makes sure that we cant return a null value in the place of a Job object.
  # In GraphQL ALL FIELDS ARE NULLABLE BY DEFAULT.
  jobs: [Job!]
}

# This is a custom object type in a GraphQL schema.
# It defines a Job type with three fields: id, title, and description.
type Job {
  # This ID is a scalar type in GraphQL that represents a unique identifier.
  # There are other scalar types like String, Int, Float, Boolean.
  
  # Now this ID is a non-nullable field, meaning it must always have a value.
  # If we dont return a value for this field in the resolvers, GraphQL will throw an error.
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  description: String
