/**
 * Whats a middleware?
 * A middleware is a function that has access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle.
 * The next middleware function is commonly denoted by a variable named next.
 * Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:
 * 1. Execute any code.
 * 2. Make changes to the request and the response objects.
 * 3. End the request-response cycle.
 * 4. Call the next middleware function in the stack.
 * If the current middleware function does not end the request-response cycle, it must call next() to pass control to the next middleware function. 
 * Otherwise, the request will be left hanging.

/**
 * In a typical Express application, we have handlers like a Login handler.
 * A express app typically sends requests to a handler.
 * But we can have a middleware that runs before the handler.
 * Middlware -> a logic which sits in the middle of a request and a handler.
 * Example, the JSON middleware automatically transforms the incoming request body into a JS object.
 * We can do this transformation in a common middleware instead of doing it in every handler.
 * Another example is to have middleware that checks if a request includes a authorization token.
 * If not, the middleware responds with an error.
 * If yes, it allows the request to proceed to the handler.
 */

/**
 * Our express app is already using these 3 middlewares.
 * 1. cors() - Allows the server to accept requests from different origins. 
    Without this, if the frontend is hosted on a different domain or port, the browser would block requests to our server due to CORS policy.
 * 2. express.json() - Parses the request body and makes it a JS object accessible via req.body.
 * 3. authMiddleware - Handles authentication; checks for a valid token in the request headers and verifies it.
    If the token is valid, it allows the request to proceed; otherwise, it responds with an error.

The order of middleware matters. They are executed in the order they are added.
These middlewares ensure that the server can handle cross-origin requests, parse JSON data, and authenticate users before they access protected routes or resources.
